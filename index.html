    <h2>The Laser Maze Game</h2>

    <h3>Why I Created It</h3>
    <p>
      I made this project for a few reasons. One of my students gave me the idea for this project. Not only was this a really fun challenge, it highlights a small piece of most of my skills and understanding.
      I wasn’t aiming for a large project with hundreds of features, but rather something easy to understand, easy to explore, and filled with core concepts.
    </p>
    <p>
      My goal was to make a basic Laser Maze example with the best code formatting I could. Every line of code and architecture design decision prioritizes conciseness and readability.
      This project was built to be a portfolio piece that is easily digestible. 
    </p>
    <p><i>Any code reviews, questions, and comments would be greatly appreciated.</i></p>

    <h3>The Concepts Highlighted</h3>

    <h4>Object-Oriented Design</h4>
    <p>
      OOP is used primarily for abstraction and clarity. For example, the <code>Graphics</code> class extends <code>JFrame</code> for rendering, and the <code>Controls</code> class extends <code>MouseListener</code> to manage user input.
      These relationships clarify each class’s purpose without overcomplicating reuse.
    </p>

    <h4>Data Structures</h4>
    <p>
      A <code>HashMap</code> tracks mirror objects. Custom <code>equals</code> and <code>hashCode</code> methods ensure mirrors with the same (x, y) position are treated as duplicates, regardless of rotation.
      I considered using Java's record type, but the rotation field needed mutability, so I chose a traditional class instead.
    </p>

    <h4>Algorithmic Thinking</h4>
    <p>
      The laser algorithm simulates a beam hopping through a grid, changing direction when hitting mirrors. Using trigonometric logic, the beam reflects realistically,
      and a line is drawn for each hop to form a continuous beam. This demonstrates solving a difficult problem by breaking it down into a sequence of smaller, more digestable algorithmic steps.
    </p>

    <h4>Reflection and Annotations</h4>
    <p>
      I created custom annotations and used reflection to enforce that certain classes include specific parameters — such as a <code>Graphics</code> object for rendering or a <code>MouseEvent</code> for handling input.
      This shows my ability to write self-validating, scalable code.
    </p>

    <h4>Unit Testing for Complex Logic</h4>
    <p>
      Unit tests are included for the core multi-step logic. While I don’t test every line, I believe complex processes should be validated thoroughly.
    </p>

    <h4>UI Concepts</h4>
    <p>
      Basic UI interactions demonstrate an understanding of <code>MouseEvent</code> handling and rendering with <code>java.awt.Graphics</code>.
    </p>

    <h4>Clean Code Practices</h4>
    <p>
      All functions are concise and follow the single-responsibility principle. Indentation is deliberate, emphasizing simplicity and maintainability.
    </p>

    <h4>Thoughtful Code Comments</h4>
    <p>
      Comments focus on explaining <em>why</em> decisions were made, not just what the code does — making the project easier to understand and maintain.
    </p>

    <h4>Design Principles</h4>
    <p>
      The code follows modern, maintainable design principles — including enforcing contracts via annotations, minimizing class responsibilities, and ensuring the code is modular, testable, and easy to expand.
    </p>

    <h4>Packaging, Deployment, and GitHub Distribution</h4>
    <p>
      The project is packaged as a downloadable JAR and hosted on GitHub Pages — entirely free to use. The full source code is available on GitHub.
      Contributions are welcome!
    </p>

    <p><strong>Possible feature ideas include:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Add a menu to choose mirror count and grid size</li>
      <li>Implement a level system</li>
      <li>Create a mode where the laser must hit 3 specific targets</li>
      <li>Add multiplayer using Express.js (LAN server with octet parsing, hosting/joining)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What I'm Looking For</h3>
    <p>
      I’m looking for hands-on experience working with a professional software team — ideally one where I can learn from experienced developers.
      After three years of teaching computer programming, I’m ready to return to a learning role and deepen my understanding of real-world software development.
    </p>

    <p><strong>My goals are to:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Understand how professional development teams operate</li>
      <li>Strengthen my skills with the Java tech stack, including:</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>Spring Boot (my custom annotation experience gives me insight into how Spring works internally)</li>
      <li>PostgreSQL</li>
      <li>Maven and related tools</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      While I’ve used these technologies independently, I know the right team will help me grow faster and prepare me for long-term success.
